# Capstone task: 

### Online Store

My own little web store which is simple to use and easy to navigate through. Purchase goods quick and easily in the **31Studios** store. This project was done to show my *skills* as a *developer* so far and hopefully it's not that bad.

How it works:
- In the catalog page you can click on the items you want which adds them to the cart.
- The cart will display the products selected and the cost of each product corresponding with the chosen quantity.
- When pressing the **confirm purchase** button, an alert will show up with your total cart cost with vat included
- Press ok and you will recieve an alert which thanks you for shopping in the store and you will get a reference number for your purchase.
